This repository contains a custom shell implementation that supports the `wasm32-wasi` target; with an extended set of system calls implemented by [wasi_ext_lib](https://github.com/antmicro/wasi_ext_lib).

## Build for wasi target
You will need a custom Rust nightly toolchain that builds [`wasi_ext_lib`](https://github.com/antmicro/wasi_ext_lib) project. Get the custom Rust compiler by following the intructions in [`build`](https://github.com/antmicro/wasi_ext_lib#build) and [`Rust library`](https://github.com/antmicro/wasi_ext_lib#rust-library) sections. It is required to define [`WASI_SDK_PATH`](https://github.com/antmicro/wasi_ext_lib#build) environment variable.

After completing the previous steps, with the following command you can build `wash`:

```
cargo +stage2 build --target wasm32-wasi --release
```
